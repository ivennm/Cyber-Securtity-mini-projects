# Cyber-Securtity-mini-projects

Most of these are simple projects that "break" into fake accounts using brute force methods and simple python logic
or encrypt or decrypt using the crypto-cypher module.

The website data fetcher is slightly more interesting. It is a simple website that mimics a fake banking site. If someone
where to try to log into my mimiced version of the site, they would be redirected to the "real" banking site and loged in
and the log in data would be stored in both a new file on my local machine and in a secret part of the website.
